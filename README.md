# Shortest-path-using-A-Star-algorithm-and-Python
This Python project uses the A* pathfinding algorithm to visualize shortest paths on a grid-based map. Inspired by an Instagram reel comparing different algorithms for finding the shortest path, this project demonstrates the A* algorithm in action using the Pygame module.
